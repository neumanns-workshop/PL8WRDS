### **Impact Summary:**
- **Maintainability**: Dramatically improved - code is now organized by single responsibilities
- **Testability**: Much easier to write unit tests for focused components and services  
- **Extensibility**: Adding new features will be significantly easier
- **Performance**: Better opportunities for optimization with smaller, focused modules
- **Developer Experience**: Clean, modern React and TypeScript patterns throughout

### **Remaining Items - All Deferred (703 lines):**
All remaining files are at manageable sizes and have been intentionally deferred for future feature development phases:

- **`src/utils/dynamicMapBackground.ts` (229 lines)** - Animation system - best refactored during feature enhancements
- **`src/components/CollectionModal.tsx` (167 lines)** - Modal component - working well, can refactor when adding features
- **`src/theme/VintageTheme.ts` (161 lines)** - Theme configuration - low priority, manageable size
- **`src/App.tsx` (146 lines)** - Main app component - manageable size, good entry point
