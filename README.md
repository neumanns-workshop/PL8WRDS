# PL8WRDS: Complete Client-Side Word Game

A comprehensive license plate word game with **15,715+ collectible plates** and **7+ million pre-computed ensemble scores**. Designed for complete offline gameplay with real 3-dimensional scoring system.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**PL8WRDS** is the classic license plate word game where players find words containing license plate letters **in the correct order** (but not necessarily consecutive). Each possible 3-letter combination is a unique collectible plate with its own difficulty rating and complete solution set with ensemble scores.

### Example Gameplay
- **Plate**: `ABC`  
- **Valid solutions**: `about` (ensemble: 68), `cabinet` (ensemble: 54), `fabric` (ensemble: 42)
- **Invalid**: `cab` (wrong order), `bac` (wrong order)

## 🏆 Key Features

- **🎯 Complete Coverage**: All 7+ million valid English word solutions included
- **💎 Collectible System**: 15,715+ unique plates with difficulty ratings
- **📊 Ensemble Scoring**: Real 3D scoring (Vocabulary + Information + Orthography)  
- **⚡ Offline Ready**: Complete client-side gameplay (~27MB total)
- **🎨 Optimized Storage**: Ultra-efficient data format with pre-computed scores
- **📈 Smart Distributions**: Log-scaled difficulty visualization, high-resolution score charts

## 📊 Scoring System

Our **ensemble scoring system** provides meaningful word evaluation across three dimensions:

- **Vocabulary Sophistication** (0-100): Based on corpus frequency and rarity
- **Information Content** (0-100): Contextual information density for the specific plate
- **Orthographic Complexity** (0-100): Letter pattern complexity and visual difficulty
- **Ensemble Score**: Average of all three components for balanced evaluation

### Difficulty Rating
Plates are rated by **solution count** (fewer solutions = harder):
- **Ultra Hard** (90-100): Very few solutions (< 25 words)
- **Very Hard** (80-89): Limited solutions (25-50 words)  
- **Hard** (60-79): Moderate solutions (50-100 words)
- **Medium** (30-59): Good selection (100-200 words)
- **Easy** (0-29): Many solutions (200+ words)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download Game Data
```bash
# Complete game data (optimized format)
curl -O https://your-cdn.com/pl8wrds_complete.json.gz  # ~25MB
curl -O https://your-cdn.com/words/dictionary.json     # Word properties
```

### 2. Basic Usage
```javascript
// Load complete game data
const gameData = await loadCompressedJSON('pl8wrds_complete.json.gz');
const wordDict = await loadJSON('words/dictionary.json');

// Get solutions for any plate
const plate = gameData.plates[1337];
console.log(`Plate: ${plate.letters.join('')}`);
console.log(`Difficulty: ${plate.difficulty}/100`);
console.log(`Solutions: ${Object.keys(plate.solutions).length}`);

// Get word details with ensemble scores
Object.entries(plate.solutions).forEach(([wordId, infoScore]) => {
  const word = wordDict[wordId];
  const ensemble = (word.frequency_score + infoScore + word.orthographic_score) / 3;
  console.log(`${word.word}: ensemble ${ensemble.toFixed(1)} (V:${word.frequency_score}, I:${infoScore}, O:${word.orthographic_score})`);
});
```

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### Ultra-Optimized Ensemble Scoring
- **Pre-computed word properties**: Frequency and orthographic scores bundled with dictionary
- **Runtime context scoring**: Only information scores computed per plate-word pair
- **3D visualization**: Component score breakdown with real mathematical foundation
- **Performance**: 23-second total generation time (from 33+ hour initial estimate)

### Advanced Data Optimization
- **Split architecture**: Word properties separate from context-dependent scores
- **Efficient storage**: `{word_id: info_score}` mapping instead of full objects  
- **Smart compression**: Gzip + optimized JSON structure
- **Zero redundancy**: Each word stored once, referenced by ID

### Superior Visualization
- **Log-scaled difficulty**: Handles 1-10,000+ solution range properly
- **High-resolution scoring**: 80-bin histograms for clear distribution patterns
- **Real-time percentiles**: Accurate ranking against all plates
- **Component breakdown**: Individual score visualization per word
