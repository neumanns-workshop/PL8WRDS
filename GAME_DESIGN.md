# PL8WRDS: Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A digital license plate word game that captures the excitement of the classic car game while adding structured progression, social sharing, and competitive collection mechanics.

## Game Mechanics

### Two-Metric Plate System
Instead of a single "difficulty" score, each plate has two distinct attributes:

- **Quality Score**: Average ensemble score of all solutions (measures word impressiveness)
  - High quality = sophisticated vocabulary, rare words
  - Low quality = common, simple words
  
- **Solution Count**: Number of valid English words that can be formed
  - High count = many discovery opportunities, beginner-friendly
  - Low count = limited solutions, expert challenge

This creates four natural plate categories:
- **üèÜ Legendary** (High Quality + Low Count): Tournament champions
- **üíé Premium** (High Quality + High Count): Discovery goldmines  
- **üéØ Training** (Medium Quality + High Count): Skill builders
- **‚ö° Quick Win** (Low Quality + High Count): Confidence boosters
